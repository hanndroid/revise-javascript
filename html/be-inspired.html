      <h2 class= "be-inspired-names">Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">Today, Ada is the face of the campaign to raise the profile of women in Stem subjects. She is often called the world's first 
        computer programmer, having wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper 
        (it was back in the 1840's!) Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of the time.
      </p> 
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Dr Sue Black</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">
      Sue is a computer scientist and a prominent campaigner for women‚Äôs rights and
