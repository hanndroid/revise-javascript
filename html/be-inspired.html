      <h2 class= "be-inspired-names">Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">Today, Ada is the face of the campaign to raise the profile of women in Stem subjects. She is often called the world's first 
        computer programmer, having wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper 
        (it was back in the 1840's!) Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of the time.
      </p> 
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Susan Wojcicki</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">Susan grew up surrounded by Stem- her father was a professor of physics
        at Stanford University and as a child she lived on campus, making her neighbours some pretty famous mathematicians. 
        She joined Google the year after it was founded and has been behind many of the search engine‚Äôs most 
        defining features, including creating the first ever Google Doodle. She became head of YouTube in 2014.
      </p> 
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Belinda Parmar</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">One of the UK‚Äôs leading campaigners to get more women into tech, Belinda Parmar 
        is the founder of Little Miss Geek and chief executive of Lady Geek. She was awarded an OBE for services 
        to women in technology in 2014 following campaigns like Her In Hero which brought in support from senior 
        politicians. She has explained her campaigning, saying: ‚ÄúDiversity is important in any industry, but is 
        especially relevant when it comes to technology. Tech is the way that world talks to each other.‚Äù</p>
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Martha Lane Fox</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">After developing an early interest in the internet, Martha Lane Fox founded Lastminute.com 
        in 1998. She has since gone on to become perhaps the UK‚Äôs most powerful digital campaigner after she was 
        appointed to be the government‚Äôs Digital Inclusion Champion and later entered the House of Lords as its
         youngest female member. In a recent Richard Dimbleby Lecture she said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know exactly how it 
         happened but the absence of women is having a profound impact on the services we use everyday.‚Äù
      </p> 
  
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Juliana Rotich</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">The executive director of Ushahidi, a not-for-profit company that develops free open-source
         software, Juliana Rotich has pioneered new web tools for crowdsourcing crisis information. Originally from 
         Kenya, she studied IT at university and became a well known blogger. Her software firm first came to prominence
         during the Kenyan presidential election crisis in 2007, using web, mobile and geolocation data to provide
         report updates.</p>
      <h2 class="be-inspired-names">Sheryl Sandberg</h2>
      <p class="be-inspired-content">As chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg is one of the world‚Äôs most 
        high-profile women in the tech sector. After an economics degree and a stint at Google, she was hired by 
        Facebook in 2008 and later became the first woman on the company‚Äôs board. She has also been a champion 
        of gender equality ‚Äì in her book about women in work, Lean In, she writes: ‚ÄúWe stand on the shoulders of 
        the women who came before us, women who had to fight for the rights that we now take for granted.‚Äù
