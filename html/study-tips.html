        <p class="pomodoro-des">
          What is it? The Pomodoro Technique is a great way to manage your time
          and keep focused. You separate your time into intervals, which are
          usually 25 minutes long. Once you have worked or studied for 25
          minutes, you take a short break - usually 5 minutes long. Once you
          have completed 4 'Pomodoro's', you can take a longer break.

          Fun Fact: The name Pomodoro comes from the Italian word for Tomato.
          Francesco Cirillo, who developed the method, used a Tomato shaped
          timer while he was a student!
